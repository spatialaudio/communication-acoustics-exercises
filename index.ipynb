    "1. [Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs)](brir.ipynb), part 1\n",

    "\n",
    "### Static Online Version\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks for each topic are available as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises/) as well as for interactive use with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (formerly known as [IPython](http://ipython.org/)), to be [downloaded from Github](http://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Notebooks from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "We should use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to pull the files (or download the [zip file](https://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises/archive/master.zip)).\n",
    "If we are new to Git, we should have a look at this [introduction to Git](http://mg.rtfd.org/git.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can also download individual notebook files (with the extension `.ipynb`) and open them in IPython.\n",
    "However, some exercises make use of additional files (audio files etc.) which we will then also have to download manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage of Anconda Python Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to utilize the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distribution platform for Python 3.x to work on the notebooks on a local PC, we can create a dedicated environment `mycomac` using the `environment.yml` in the `.binder` subfolder.\n",
    "So, firstly we should make sure that we are in the `communication-acoustics-exercises` folder of our choice, e.g.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        cd git/communication-acoustics-exercises/\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we create the environment by\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda env create -f /.binder/environment.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we activate the environment by\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda activate mycomac\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to have explicit knowledge which ipykernel belongs to our environment, so we explicitly install it with a dedicated name\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -m ipykernel install --user --name mycomac --display-name \"mycomac\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We start a jupyter lab session from terminal \n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter lab\n",
    "\n",
    "and can play around with the Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "We should ensure that we use the `mycomac` kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might want to remove an ipykernel named `mycomac` and/or an existing `mycomac` environment once in a while by\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter kernelspec uninstall mycomac\n",
